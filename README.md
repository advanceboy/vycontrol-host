VyControl is a single frontend interface to manage a single or multiple VyoS servers. Only download [VyOS](https://www.vyos.io/) Rolling Release, since VyControl needs the latest VyOS API.


Still in 2020, the most important functionalities that until then were only possible through CLI (command line interface), will be possible through a friendly web interface developed in Django / Python.

Standalone VyoS installations can now have a control panel.

Datacenter installations with multiple VyoS will be able to offer their customers (with users, groups and granular control) firewall as a service.
